We have to make provisions in the frontend for when the word list
is too long.

We also have to add the ability to remove a word from our list.

We also want to have a frontend tool for inputting the words that
you want, and then you can also specify any additional search to
go along with that word (should help for sentences).

We also want to be able to remove certain images (probz more
important for if we put this up on the interwebz).

add in our reverso scraper as a tool

also make a Tool namespace.

And I guess have everything in some neutral format, so we can have
output Tools too?

run npm run install on the quasar part of the project
